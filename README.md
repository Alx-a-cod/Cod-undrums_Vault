# 🧠💻 My Coding Vault

Welcome! This is my **personal coding lab in Markdown form** — a space where problems meet solutions, experiments run wild, and occasionally sparks fly. ⚡🔥  

## What You’ll Find Here

- **📝 Problems & Solutions**  
  Organized by topics such as `arrays`, `graphs`, `dynamic programming`, and more. Each entry includes the problem description, my thought process, and the final code solution.  

- **💡 Snippets & Tricks**  
  Handy reusable functions, regex patterns, clever one-liners, and other coding shortcuts I’ve collected along the way. Perfect for those “I know I’ve solved this before” moments.  

- **🌌 Interactive Vault Experience**  
  Open this in Obsidian to explore the **graph view** — watch notes connect, expand, and occasionally plot world domination.   

## How to Navigate

1. Browse by folder → pick a problem → follow my journey from trial to solution.  
2. Clone or fork the repo to experiment, learn, or simply marvel at my debugging (mis)adventures.  

## Disclaimer

- No code was harmed during the making of this vault (except maybe my sanity).  
- Any bugs in the solutions? Consider them **intentional teaching moments**. 😎

💻 **Pro Tip:** Open in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for the full interactive experience — it’s like peeking inside my brain, safely.
